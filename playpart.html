   <h6>NURSE.</h6> 
   <p>
    At last I have found the box with the fancy dress.
</p>
    
    <h6>NORA.</h6>
    Thanks; put it on the table.
    
    NURSE.
    <p>_[doing so]_.</p> But it is very much in want of mending.
    
    NORA.
    I should like to tear it into a hundred thousand pieces.
    
    NURSE.
    What an idea! It can easily be put in order—just a little patience.
    
    NORA.
    Yes, I will go and get Mrs Linde to come and help me with it.
    
    NURSE.
    What, out again? In this horrible weather? You will catch cold, ma’am,
    and make yourself ill.
    
    NORA.
    Well, worse than that might happen. How are the children?
    
    NURSE.
    The poor little souls are playing with their Christmas presents, but—
    
    NORA.
    Do they ask much for me?
    
    NURSE.
    You see, they are so accustomed to have their mamma with them.
    
    NORA.
    Yes, but, nurse, I shall not be able to be so much with them now as I
    was before.
    
    NURSE.
    Oh well, young children easily get accustomed to anything.
    
    NORA.
    Do you think so? Do you think they would forget their mother if she
    went away altogether?</pre>
